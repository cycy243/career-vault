      <p>
        The website is first create for myself, the creator, because I wanted to keep the tracking
        of my job research in something that's more friendly to use than an excel file.<br />And I
        also wanted to add some functionnalites like exporting in pdf or excel the tracking so it's
        more easy to share it with others.
